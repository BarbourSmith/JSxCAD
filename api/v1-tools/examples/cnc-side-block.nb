This is a simple block that can be clamped to a CNC plate to hold things in place sideways.

It is designed to take an M4 bolt.

The design is built by applying subtractive tools to a block of wood.

The resulting geometry is produced as an STL file for 3d printing.

In this example we see that the LineRouter should take a parameter for an effective as well as real tool diameter.
