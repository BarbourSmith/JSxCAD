/*
A metric ISO screw thread is designated by the letter M followed by the value of the nominal diameter D (the maximum thread diameter for external thread and the minimum diameter for internal one) and the pitch P, both expressed in millimetres and separated by the hyphen sign, - (e.g., M8-1.25). If the pitch is the normally used "coarse" pitch listed in ISO 261 or ISO 262, it can be omitted (e.g., M8). The length of a machine screw or bolt is indicated by a following x and the length expressed in millimetres (e.g., M8-1.25x30 or M8x30). Tolerance classes defined in ISO 965-1 can be appended to these designations, if required (e.g., M500â€“ 6g in external threads).

External threads are designated by lowercase letter, g or h. Internal threads are designated by upper case letters, G or H.
