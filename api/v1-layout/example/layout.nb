md`# Layout

## Pages

Layout is organized around the idea of a page.

Pages can have limited size or be unlimited.

They can be packed or unpacked.
`;

const pieces = Group(...numbers((a) => Arc(1 + a / 10), { to: 10 }));

md`### Unlimited Page`;
pieces.pack().view();
md`The page is expanded until all content can be packed.`;

md`### Limited Page`;
pieces.page({ size: [20, 30] }).view();
md`An additional page is added to fix the content.`;

md`### Fixed Layout`;
pieces.move(1, 1.5).fix().view();
md`No packing or layout occurs.`;
