md`# Deform Operations`;

md`We can deform shapes in a couple of ways.`;

md`## shape.arch(degree)`;
const arch = Cube(2, 10, 10).arch(5);
arch.view();

md`shape is arched along the X asis upward along the Z axis to the degree provided.`;

md`## shape.crumple(degree, { resolution = 1, seed = 1 })`;
const crumple = Cube(10).crumple(1);
crumple.view();
md`shape is crumpled by the degree provided.`;

md`## shape.skew(degree)`;
const skew = Cube(5, 10, 10).skew(5);
skew.view();
md`shape is skewed along the X asis upward along the Z axis to the degree provided.`;

md`## shape.taper(scale)`;
const taper = Cube(10).taper(0.5);
taper.view();
md`shape is tapered upward along the Z axis from a scaling of 1.0 to the scale given.`;

md`## shape.twist(angle)`;
const twist = Cube(10).twist(45);
twist.view();
md`shape is twisted around the Z axis reaching the specified angle at the top of the object.`;
