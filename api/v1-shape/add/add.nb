Shape.add extends a shape to cover the other shapes.

---

For example, we can add the shape of a blue Arc to a red Box.
Note that the result is red, since the red box was extended to cover the area of the blue arc.
`;
  
Box(20).color('red')
  .add(Arc(12).color('blue'))
  .topView();

We can also add the shape of a Prism to a Square.
This adds the area of the prism in the plane of the square to the square.
`;
  
Box(20)
  .add(Rod(16, 6).sides(5))
  .topView();

And we can add a Prism to a Cube.
`;
  
Rod(7, 16).sides(5)
  .add(Box(6, 6, 6))
  .view();
