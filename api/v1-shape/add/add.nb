Shape.add extends a shape to cover the other shapes.

---

For example, we can add the shape of a blue Circle to a red Square.
Note that the result is red, since the red square was extended to cover the area of the blue circle.
`;
  
Square(20).color('red')
  .add(Circle(12).color('blue'))
  .topView();

We can also add the shape of a Prism to a Square.
This adds the area of the prism in the plane of the square to the square.
`;
  
Square(20)
  .add(Prism(16, 6))
  .topView();

And we can add a Prism to a Cube.
`;
  
Prism(7, 16)
  .add(Cube(12))
  .view();
