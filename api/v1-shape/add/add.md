Shape.add extends a shape to cover the other shapes.

---

For example, we can add the shape of a blue Circle to a red Square.
Note that the result is red, since the red square was extended to cover the area of the blue circle.

We can also add the shape of a Prism to a Square.
This adds the area of the prism in the plane of the square to the square.
